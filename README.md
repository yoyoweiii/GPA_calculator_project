App Dev Emerging Tech

THis is one of the projects for a semester that I make a simple calculator to measure one's GPA score
No matter what kind of score(ex: 5, 99, B) you have typed in, I will transfer them into GPA score
For this, there are a lot of input you need to type such as ccourse credits or how many courses you still need to graduate.
There are two files that one is for high school students and the another one is for college students.
